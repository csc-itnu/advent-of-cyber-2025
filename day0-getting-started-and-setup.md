## 🎭 Storyline (Official AoC 2025 Plot)
Wareville—home of **The Best Festival Company (TBFC)**—is preparing for SOCMAS, their annual cyber celebration.  
But things are already breaking:

- Systems glitch  
- Passwords fail  
- Operations are unstable  

McSkidy (THM’s SOC analyst) notices a recurring name:

**👉 King Malhare**

Before joining the SOCMAS Response Team, participants must complete **10 warm-up missions**.  
Each mission teaches a core cybersecurity skill and reveals clues related to King Malhare.

Day 0 tasks are **pure preparation**, not exploitation. They ensure you can:

- Navigate Linux and Windows  
- Analyze simple logs  
- Perform basic malware and password checks  
- Understand security hygiene  
- Recognize suspicious activity  

This sets you up for the real technical story starting Day 1.
